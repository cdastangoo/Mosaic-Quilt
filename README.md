# Mosaic Quilt
This is an implementation of various image processing algorithms from scratch.
Includes basic pixel operations like brightness, contrast, and saturation, as well as image convolution operations such as sharpening, blurring, edge detection, and dithering.

Applies a quilt-like mosaic mask given a data set of album and film covers.
This works by parsing through the image in rectangular series of pixels, and finding the album/film cover that most closely matches the average color of each pixel selection.
